# Privacy Policy for BetterHalo

BetterHalo is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Usage
BetterHalo accesses your Halo LMS data (such as course lists, assessment titles, due dates, and grades) to provide features such as the "Upcoming Assessments" feature on your homepage.

*   **Local Processing:** All data retrieved from Halo LMS is processed locally within your browser.
*   **No Data Transmission:** BetterHalo does not transmit your personal data, grades, or browsing history to any external servers or third parties.

## Permissions
*   **Storage:** Used to save your preferred Halo URL.
*   **Cookies:** Used to retrieve authentication tokens from your active Halo session.
*   **WebNavigation:** Used to detect when you navigate between pages in the Halo SPA to ensure the UI updates correctly.
*   **Host Permissions (`*.gcu.edu`):** Necessary to fetch your course information from the official Halo API.

## Changes to This Policy
We will *NEVER* transmit your data to any servers under our control or sell your data. However, the wording of this policy might be tweaked every once in a while. Any changes will correspond with an update to the extension.
