# BetterHalo

BetterHalo is a browser extension designed to enhance the Halo LMS experience. It is intended to be an analogue to [BetterCanvas](https://github.com/UseBetterCanvas/bettercanvas) designed for the Halo LMS system.

## Features
- **Upcoming Assessments:** See what's due in the next for all your classes at a glance, right at the homepage.
- **Real-time Updates:** Automatically refreshes when you load your homepage to make sure you have the latest info.
- **Privacy Focused:** All data is processed locally in your browser. No data is ever sent to external servers.

## Manual Installation

### Chrome / Edge / Brave
1. Open `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/` or `brave://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `BetterHalo` folder.

### Firefox
1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...** and select the `manifest.json` file.

## Configuration
There is not much configuration yet. As more features are added, configuration elements can be accessed by clicking the BetterHalo icon in your add-on toolbar.

## Test Drive
Since GCU provides a [test drive instance](https://testdrive.gcu.edu) of the Halo LMS, you can try it out even without a Halo account. Just open the configuration and set the Halo URL to `https://testdrive.gcu.edu` and open the student instance to get a feel of how the extension works.
